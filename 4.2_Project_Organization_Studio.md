***Setting project Compatibility***

When creating a new project in Studio, you must select the compatibility based on the environment on which the project will be executed: 

- Windows - Uses .NET 6 with Windows support. This is the default option.

- Cross-platform - Uses .NET 6 with cross-platform support.

- Windows - Legacy - Uses .NET Framework 4.6.1. the compatibility used in releases prior to 2021.10.

  

***Notes :***

- The Windows - Legacy option will no longer be available for new projects in the near future. We recommend selecting Windows or Cross-platform when creating a new project.

  
- Windows and Cross-platform processes require Orchestrator 2021.10 and newer to run.



# Project Organization Best Practices


***Pick Suitable Layout For Project***



- Though automations can be built using either sequences, flowcharts, or state machines some tasks are better suited for one over the others. 


- For example, the main workflow works better as a flowchart as it easier to visualize the entire project.


- State machines are ideal for the main workflow when you have multiple strict conditions for when a workflow can move from one state to another.


- In general, higher-level decisions or business led decisions work better in a flowchart or a state machine.


- On the other hand, sequences are best suited for UI interactions performed in succession without much variation.





***Organize Projects Into Smaller Workflows***


- Splitting projects into smaller workflows and using Invoke Workflow File activities is paramount to good project design.


- Dedicated workflows allow independent testing of components, encourage team collaboration, and improve design and execution performance when compared to projects organized in fewer, larger files.


- We recommend keeping workflow file sizes under 5 MB. Workflow files over 10 MB are not supported.





***Use Exception Handling to Capture Errors***


- You can put complex or problematic parts of a workflow inside a Try/Catch block to ensure that the automation will not crash or stop for every minor error that it may encounter.


- Try/Catch can also be used when using external workflow files as it helps in debugging.






***Handle Credential Carefully***


- No credentials should be stored in the workflow directly, but rather loaded from safer places like local Windows Credential Store or Orchestrator assets.



- You can use them in workflows via the Get Credential activity.



***Make Your Workflows Readable***


- Giving descriptive names to all components and providing clarifying notes and comments is imperative to make your automations more readable not just for yourself but for other developers as well.


- Log the execution progress as well to as it helps you locate any errors faster.




***Keep Your Automation Clean***

- In the process flow, make sure you close the target applications (browsers, apps) after the Robots interact with them.


- If left open, they use the machine resources and may interfere with the other steps of automation.

- Remove unreferenced variables.

- Delete temporary Write Line outputs.

- Delete disabled code.

- Remove unnecessary containers.
