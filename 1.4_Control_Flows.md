# ***The workflow layouts***

- ***Workflow*** : (Sequence of activities)

- ***Sequence*** : (Activities in sequences are easier to read and maintain. Act as a single block of activity )

- ***Flowchart*** :  (Use flowcharts when decision points and branching are needed  )

- ***State Machine*** :  ( That uses a finite number of states in its execution)

- ***Global Exception Handler*** : (A workflow layout designed to determine the behaviour when encountering an execution error at the project level)
- One Global Exception Handler per project.
- It redirects the uncaught exceptions or errors to Global Handler.
- You can choose the action to be taken after the Global Exception Handler steps in;
- Continue(The exception is re-thrown),
- Ignore ( The exception is ignored and execution continues from the next activity),
- Retry (the activity which threw the exception is retried),
- Abort (The execution stops after running the current handler)

# ***The most common control flow statements are***
- If, 
- While, 
- Do While, 
- For Each, 
- Switch, 
- Parallel.

***If***
- Useful only with two potential courses of action.
- Uses a condition that is boolean in nature.
- Workflow design with multiple nested If-Else looks cluttered and difficult to follow.

***While loop***
- Executes contained activities while the condition is True.
- Iterates as long as the condition is met.
- Exits upon checking if the condition is false.

***Do While loop***
- While loop executes a section of code until the statement is fulfilled,
- Do-while loop executes all of the phrases inside the loop precisely once before assessing the loopâ€™s requirement
- It runs at least once irrespective of whether the situation is fulfilled.

***For Each loop***
- Performs an activity or series of activities on each element of an enumeration.
- Iterates through each element in the collection.
- Exits upon completion of processing of each item in the collection.

***Switch***
- Useful when we need at least three potential sources of action.
- Uses a condition that is not boolean. But enables the selection of one choice out of multiple, based on the value of a specified expression. 
- Workflow design with multiple nested If-Else replaced by switch activity is easy to follow.
- By default, switch activity uses an integer argument in the Case Value section in Studio.
