# Version Control System

- A version control system (VCS), also known as a source control system or revision control system, is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to their source code and other files.

- It provides a structured approach to track, document, and control different versions of files, enabling collaboration, facilitating team workflows, and ensuring code integrity.

- UiPath projects are typically developed using external version control systems to manage source code and track changes over time.

- You can use any version control system that suits your requirements, such as Git, SVN (Subversion), or TFS (Team Foundation Server).

- UiPath projects are usually stored as collections of files, including workflow files (.xaml), configuration files, and other supporting

# Git

- An open-source distributed version control system, empowers users to efficiently and collaboratively manage source code and project files.
- It actively tracks changes to files, enabling easy switching between different versions, branch creation for experimentation, merging of changes, and seamless collaboration.
- Git facilitates both local and remote work, making it convenient for individual developers and teams alike.
- It offers numerous benefits, including version history, streamlined rollback, conflict resolution, and seamless integration with popular development platforms.
- Its flexibility, speed, and robustness have established Git as the de facto standard for version control in the software development industry.
- Additionally, Git provides excellent support for branching, merging, and repository history rewriting, with the added advantage of the widely-used pull request feature that facilitates efficient code review and collaboration within teams.
- As the most widely adopted version control system globally, Git has solidified its position as the modern standard in software development. 

# How Git works?

1) Create a repository (project) with a Git hosting tool.
2) Copy or clone the repository to your local machine.
3) Add a file to your local repository and commit (save) the changes locally.
4) Push your changes to the remote repository.
5) Pull the file to local repository and make changes, and then commit and push the file.
6) Create a branch (alternative), make a change, commit the change.
7) Open a pull request (propose changes to the master branch).
8) Merge your branch to the master branch.




# Comparing SVN and Git Side-by-Side 

- SVN (Subversion) and Git are both popular version control systems used in software development.
- While they serve similar purposes, they differ in their underlying architecture, workflow models, and features.
