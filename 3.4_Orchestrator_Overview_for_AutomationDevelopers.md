# Orchestrator concepts

***Robot(Orchestrator)***
- By now you're familiar with UiPath Robot, the component of the UiPath Platform.
- This is an execution host that runs automation processes published in Orchestrator, as jobs.
- In Orchestrator, a robot entity represents an image or the Robot component, controlling its connection and capabilities.
- The robot entity exists only if it is defined in relation to a user/ robot account in Orchestrator.


***Folder***
- Folders enable the separation and hierarchical organization of automation entities (processes, queues, assets) and the fine-grained configuration of roles and permissions.
- You can create as many sibling folders as you want on a given level.
- The maximum hierarchy depth is 7, meaning you can have a maximum number of 6 nested subfolders under a first-level folder.
- Folders help replicate the organizational hierarchies, with the separation of automated processes between teams, segregation of process data, and access control for users.
- At the same time, when it makes sense, they allow sharing of the resources and assets.

***Package***
- A project developed in UiPath Studio that is published to Orchestrator as a NuGet package.
- Multiple versions of the same project can be stored and used.
- Packages can also be manually uploaded to Orchestrator.
- Additionally, by viewing the versions for a package you can download it from Orchestrator.

***Process***
- It is a version of a package that's been allocated to a certain folder.
- Given that most processes use a queue, asset, or storage bucket, the Package Requirements tab, for when adding a new process, makes it easy to identify which entities your package is using and if they are missing from your folder.

***Job***
- Represents the execution of a process on a UiPath Robot.
- You can launch the execution of a job in either attended or unattended mode.
- You cannot launch a job from Orchestrator on attended robots, unless for debugging purposes using personal workspaces, and they cannot run under a locked screen.

***HeartBeat***
- Attended and unattended robots send a heartbeat to Orchestrator every 30 seconds. This signals to Orchestrator that the connection is working.



# Tenant entities


- From the entities defined above, robots are tenant entities.
-  This means that they can be allocated to multiple folders in that tenant.
-  Using roles and permissions, the way robots work with each of the folders can be customized. 
- Packages are published to Orchestrator using feeds.
- The feeds can be configured to be at tenant level, or at folder level.
- A package published to the tenant feed can then be used in a process in any of the folders. If it is published using a folder feed, it can't be used for processes in other folders.

***There are a couple of other Orchestrator entities which exist at the tenant level:***


***User***
- Both human users and robots are uniquely identified with users in Orchestrator.
- On the Accounts & Groups page, in Automation Cloud, you can define local user accounts, robot accounts, and local groups for your organization.
- The level of access and the actions that your users can perform is controlled using two elements:

    accounts, which establish the identity of a user and are used to log in to your UiPath applications
    roles, which are assigned to accounts in order to grant them certain permissions within the UiPath ecosystem.
- Accounts are not created or managed in Orchestrator, only roles and their assignments are.


***Machines***
- These are Orchestrator entities corresponding to the workstations where human users and robots work.
- Using API keys, they enable the connection between the physical or virtual machines and Orchestrator.

***Licences***
- The right to use Studio and/or Robots, both attended and unattended, is done through licenses.
- Licenses exist at tenant level, from where they get distributed to users, and consumed when the machines connect to Orchestrator.


***WebHook***
- Webhooks facilitate the communication between Orchestrator and other applications at API level.
- These are mapped at tenant level, which means they cannot be differentiated between folders and will provide information for the entire tenant.


# Folder entities

- A folder is a storage area that helps keep your projects separate.
- From the entities defined at the beginning of the lesson, processes and jobs are folder entities. Packages depend on feed configuration.

***Asset***
- An asset is a piece of data stored in Orchestrator for the use of robots. There are four types of assets:

    Text - stores only strings (it isn't required to add quotation marks).
    Bool - supports true or false values.
    Integer - stores only whole numbers.
    Credential - contains usernames and passwords that the Robot requires to execute particular processes, such as login details.

- Assets can have a global value or a value per user. This means that only the specified user will access a certain value stored in that asset.


***Storage buckets***
- Storage buckets are entities used for storing files which can be used in automation projects.


***Queue***
- Queues are containers that can hold an unlimited number of items, storing different types of data.
- The process of feeding items to a queue is typically different from the process of processing the queue items, and is handled by different robots.


***Trigger***
- Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a preplanned manner:
- Time triggers—they instruct the automation to start at regular intervals.
- Queue triggers—they instruct the automation to be activated whenever new items are added to your queues. 
- Event triggers—they instruct the automation to start whenever a specified event occurs.





# ***Provision an Unattended Robot to Orchestrator***

***User and robot accounts***
- In Orchestrator, both human users with attended licenses (Robot or Studio) and unattended robots need to have a corresponding Orchestrator user.
- Depending on the deployment type and the organizational setup, users are added and managed in different ways:

    Users can be added locally in on-premises, standalone Orchestrator.
    Users have to be added in Automation Cloud, then in cloud Orchestrator to grant them a license.
    Users can be added from Active Directory for both on-premises and cloud Orchestrator if the integration was configured beforehand.

- Robot accounts have to be created in Automation Cloud, and they behave like user accounts regarding permissions. The only differences compared to user accounts are: 

    Robot accounts aren't allowed to have any interactive-related process configuration.
    No email address is required to create a robot account.



***Automatic Robot Creation***

- To simplify the attended and unattended robot creation, as well as the license provisioning, the automation robot creation can be enabled at user level, for both attended and unattended robots, and at group level for attended robots.
- Basically, you enable the Attended Robot or Unattended Robot toggle at the account or group level, configure the various settings (robot execution settings, machine login credentials, if applicable), and a floating robot with those attributes is created.
- Note: You can only enable attended robot auto-provisioning for user groups, unattended robot auto-provisioning is not possib


***Machine Templates***
- Robots run on physical or virtual workstations. These are mirrored in Orchestrator by entities called machines. The machines in Orchestrator work as API key generators, authorizing the connection between the robots and Orchestrator.
- There are two types of machines in Orchestrator:

    Machine templates: this allows the connection to multiple workstations with a single API key.
    Standard machines: this allows the connection between Orchestrator and a single machine. This is suitable for scenarios in which robots need to run on specific machines.


***Licences Distribution***

- In Orchestrator, licenses are also called runtimes. They're allocated at machine template level, under Machines in the Tenant menu.


- The number of runtimes allocated there should be matched with the maximum number of users which can run on a single machine connected using that machine template. On a regular Windows machine, only one user can run. - But on a Windows server machine, multiple users can run simultaneously.

- Licenses are consumed as soon as a machine is connected to Orchestrator, no matter the number of users running on it.
