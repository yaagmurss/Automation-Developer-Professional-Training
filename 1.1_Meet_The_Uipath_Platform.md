# ***Uipath Robots***

A software robot is an execution agent that runs automations built with the Studio family and then published as packages either locally, or to Orchestrator. 

 &rarr; ***Attended robots***  

- They work on the same machines as us humans, during the same hours.

- They're triggered directly by humans (usually through UiPath Assistant) or by an event related to what the human user does. For example, opening an application or receiving an email.

- UiPath Assistant is the component that provides a friendly interface to interact with attended robots. It is the tool that we use to easily access, manage, and run automations.

  

 &rarr; ***Unattended robots***  

- These are meant to work non-stop, with as little input from human users as possible. They're deployed on separate machines and their jobs are triggered exclusively from Orchestrator.

- Their interactions with human users are typically handled with as little disruption as possible, by creating and sending requests for human input or validation as tasks.

- While these await to be processed, unattended robots can continue their work by picking up other jobs. When human input is finally provided, unattended robots can resume their work on the process.

  

 &rarr; ***Automation Cloud Robots***  

- Automation Cloud Robots (ACRs) are SaaS robots hosted in the UiPath Automation Cloud that let you quickly run automations without building or managing your own unattended Robot infrastructure. They come in two flavors: 

- ***VM Automation Cloud Robots.*** : Access to a fully customizable Windows virtual machine and set up UiPath Robots to run any job in a matter of minutes.  
  
- ***Serverless Automation Cloud Robots (Linux based cloud robots)*** :Run background, cross-platform projects easily without worrying about infrastructure setup. So, you're able to provision, manage and scale these robots from Automation Cloud. In other words, UiPath takes care of everything

&rarr;  ***Test Robots*** 
 
- These robots can be deployed to execute tests on-demand, continuously, and at scale. Purpose built for testing workflows, activities, and applications. Provides flexibility in managing and reusing test cases across projects. Enables activity level unit testing out-of-the-box.


# ***Uipath Orchestrator***


- Orchestrator is a web application that allows managing, controlling, and monitoring the robots and the automations.
  
- With Orchestrator we can deploy, trigger, measure, provision, track, and ensure the security of every robot in the organization. 

- Orchestrator also functions as a repository for libraries, reusable components, assets, and processes.


***The main capabilities of Orchestrator are:***

- ***Provisioning:*** creates and maintains the connection with robots.
  
- ***Control and license distribution:*** enables the creation, assignment and maintenance of licenses, roles, permissions, groups, and folder hierarchies.

- ***Automation storage and distribution:*** allows the controlled storage and distribution of automation projects, assets, and credentials, as well as large files used in automations.

- ***Running automation jobs in unattended mode:*** enables the creation and distribution of automation jobs in various ways, including through queues and triggers.

- ***Monitoring:*** allows monitoring of jobs and robots and stores logs for auditing and analytics.

 # ***Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Glossary***
 

***Artificial intelligence (AI):***

Technology intended to respond to and learn from stimulation in a similar way to human responses with a level of understanding and judgement that's normally only found in human expertise.


***Attended RPA:*** 

Attended RPA includes scenarios where decision making and/or user input is required, such as desktop automation. These software robots work at an employee's workstation and are triggered by two situations: a user's command and instances were Robots need input from the user to continue a task. Access is often limited to the employees within a specific department or workstation.

***Automation design:***
