# Workflow Analyzer 


- Workflow Analyzer is a static code analyzer that ensures your project meets high quality and reliability standards. 
- When triggered, the Workflow Analyzer uses the configured rule set to check the project or workflow for inconsistencies without executing the project.
- It logs the errors found in the Error List panel, under the rule action (Error, Warning, Info or Verbose). The rules are based on UiPath Automation Best Practices.

***Using the Workflow Analyzer, you can:***




 - Edit, disable and enable rules from Studio.
 - Run validation or validation and analysis at file or project level.
- Manage errors and warnings in the Error List panel.
- Build custom rules using the UiPath.Activities.Api package.
- Integrate workflow analysis with prebuilt and/or custom rules in CI/CD pipeline configurations.

# Workflow Analyzer rules categories


- In the analysis stage, your project is checked against a set of predefined rules applicable to Studio. At the moment, there are eight rule categories:

***Naming Rules***

- Rules in this category contain USG code in their ID. The rules in this category refer to requirements for ensuring elements defined in your project are actually used. Below is the list of rules:

***Design Best Practices***

- Rules in this category contain the DBP code in their ID. This category refers to requirements for ensuring your project meets a general set of best practices. Below is the list of rules:

# Few Best Practices

- If two variables with the same name exist, although we highly recommend against it, the one defined in the most inner scope has priority.     You can only assign one default case. Default cases are not numbered. 
- Reduce the number of arguments in a workflow to a minimum. 
- It is recommended to insert log messages in the Catch block of a Try Catch activity, in addition to the exception handling itself.
- It is recommended to reduce the number of flowchart layers to a minimum to ensure maintainability and readability.
- Make sure to exclude empty files from the project in order to keep only relevant workflows and to reduce the total size of the project.
- Use Wait ... and Resume persistence activities only in the workflow file that is set as Main.
- Do not use the Delay activity in the workflow file set as Main in projects that support persistence. Either move Delay activities to other workflow files in the project or use the Resume After Delay activity in the file set as Main.
- Change the argument data type to a serializable data type.
