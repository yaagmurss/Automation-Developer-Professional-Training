# System and Business exceptions

Errors are events that occur in a program and can't be handled normally. On the other hand, exceptions are events that are recognized, categorized, and handled by the program.


***Error***



- Errors are events that a particular program can’t normally deal with. There are different types of errors, based on what's causing them—for example: 


- Syntax errors, where the compiler/interpreter can't parse the written code into meaningful computer instructions.


- User errors, where the software determines that the user’s input isn't acceptable for some reason.


- Programming errors, where the program contains no syntax errors but doesn't produce the expected results. These types of errors are often called bugs.


***Exception***

- Exceptions are events that are recognized (caught) by the program, categorized, and handled. More specifically, there is a routine configured by the developer that is activated when an exception is caught. Sometimes, the handling mechanism can be simply stopping the execution.


- Some of the exceptions are linked to the systems used, while others are linked to the logic of the business process.

***System exceptions***

- The unexpected exceptions are the one known as System Exceptions (SE).

  
- They belong to the .NET framework and are categorized under the System.Exception class.

  
- Proper handling should be in place for these kinds of exceptions and they can cause the process to fail.

  

- ***NullReferenceException*** —Occurs when using a variable with no set value (not initialized).    2


- ***IndexOutOfRangeException*** —Occurs when the index of an object is out of the limits of the collection.    3


- ***ArgumentException*** —Is thrown when a method is invoked and at least one of the passed arguments doesn't meet the parameter specification of the called method.    4


- ***SelectorNotFoundException*** Is thrown when the robot is unable to find the specified selector for an activity in the target app within the Timeout period. As you know, the timeout property specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that the system will wait for an operation to finish before generating an error.


- ***ImageOperationException*** —Occurs when an image isn't found within the Timeout period.


- ***TextNotFoundException*** —Occurs when the indicated text isn't found within the Timeout period.


- ***ApplicationException*** —Describes an error rooted in a technical issue, such as an application that isn't responding.

***Business exceptions***


- The expected exceptions are the ones referred to as Business Rule Exceptions (BRE). 

- A business exception mainly refers to information used in an automated process; either it may be incomplete or incorrect from a business perspective. When business exceptions occur, robots stop the process, and it requires human intervention to address a thrown exception.


- The message associated with a business rule exception should provide meaningful information for the process.saction is not processed."

- BREs aren't automatically generated as system exceptions. They must be defined by a developer by using the Throw Activity and handled inside a TryCatch.



  

# Try Catch, Throw and Rethrow 

- The Try Catch activity catches a specified exception type in a sequence or activity, and either displays an error notification or dismisses it and continues the execution.

- As a mechanism, Try Catch runs the activities in the Try block and, if an error takes place, executes the activities in the Catches block. The Finally block is only executed when no exceptions are thrown or when an exception is caught and handled in the Catches block (without being re-thrown).


***Don'ts***

- While the Try Catch activity can be helpful, it's important to avoid excessive usage. Catching an exception should only be done when there's a valid reason to do so. 

- Technically, there is no specific limit to the number of Catch blocks you can use within a Try Catch activity in UiPath Studio. You can include multiple Catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions as needed. However, it's important to consider the readability and maintainability of your code when deciding the number of Catch blocks to include.




# Retry Scope


- The Retry Scope activity allows you to repeat the execution of enclosed activities as long as a specific condition isn't met or an error is encountered.

- ***Action Block*** – Defines actions
- ***Condition Block*** – Defines conditions(i.e. Element exists,Image Exists…)
- ***NumberOfRetries*** – The number of times that the sequence is has be retried.
- ***RetryInterval*** – Amount of time (in seconds) between each retry.
