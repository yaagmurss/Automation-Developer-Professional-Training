# The Robotic Enterprise Framework (REFramework)

- The Robotic Enterprise Framework (REFramework) is a UiPath Studio template that comes pre-built with numerous essential best practices.

- When considering these steps and how they are repeated, we can divide business processes into three categories

- The most common use case of REFramework is a transactional unattended process with a queue as data input.

The two main stages of a process involving queues are separated as follows: 

1 - The stage in which data is read, organized and fed into a queue in Orchestrator is called Dispatcher or Producer. 

2 - The stage in which the queue data is processed is called Performer or Consumer.

# Initialization state 

- Whenever a different screen resolution causes the application to rescale and fail, the screen resolution is automatically logged, and no further action is required from you. 

- The overall exception handling mechanism is already implemented throughout the framework. Thus, we can find Try Catch activities in every state. 

- To make it easier to maintain a project and quickly change configuration values the REFramework template provides a configuration file, named Config dot xlsx, located in the Data project folder.

- Reading the Configuration file is one of the key functions of the Initialization state.


- ***Constants sheet***
  

- The Constants sheet stores "technical" settings that are useful for developers. Among others, it contains information such as the number of retries, the number of consecutive system exceptions allowed, default paths, and static log message parts.
  

- ***MaxRetryNumber***
  

- It is used to determine how many times the Robot will retry a transaction which has failed with an Application Exception.
  

- ***MaxConsecutiveSystemExceptions***

 
- This constant allows us to set the maximum limit for consecutive system exceptions.When the value is set to 0, then the feature is disable.  

 
 - ***RetryNumberGetTransactionItem, and RetryNumberSetTransactionStatus***
   

 - In short, they refer to the number of times the Get Transaction Item activity and Set Transaction Status activity respectively are retried in case of an exception.


- ***ShouldMarkJobAsFaulted***

- Constant can be used to mark a job as faulted. Weâ€™ve set it to TRUE to enable this behavior.
