# Types of PDFs

***Native Pdf*** : A PDF file that is originally generated in a computer, aka "born digital", meaning that it was created from an original electronic version of a document. One quick way to tell that a PDF is native is that you can select blocks of text in the file. 

***Scanned Pdf*** : A PDF file that is made up of scanned images of a given document. With scanned PDFs you will not be able to select text or use the search function because the PDF is a collection of images. 



In PDF automation, data can be extracted using two separate activities: 
- Extract data using ***Read PDF Text activity.***
- Extract data using ***Read PDF with OCR activity.***
-  Both activities are available in the UiPath.PDF.Activities package.
