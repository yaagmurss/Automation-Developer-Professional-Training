# DataTable variables



- DataTable is the type of variable that can store data as a simple spreadsheet with rows and columns.



***Table Extraction***

- Table Extraction, part of the Modern Experience in Studio, enables you to use the UI Automation activity package to automatically extract structured data from applications and save it as a DataTable object that can then be further used in your automation processes.

- This process can be done by using the Table Extraction Recorder in Studio, which can be accessed from the Ribbon if the UI Automation v21.4 or above pack is installed in your current project, and you have selected the Modern Experience.

- The same wizard is also used when using a Extract Table Data activity in your workflow.

***Data Scraping Action***

- To use this functionality, you must switch to the Classic experience in Studio. To enable or disable the modern experience for a project, in the Project panel, select Project Settings, then use the Modern Design Experience toggle from the General tab, and reload the project.

- This functionality of UiPath Studio enables you to extract structured data from your browser, application or document to a DataTable.


***Generate Data Table From Text Activity***

- Can be used to create a DataTable from structured text, by letting the user indicate the row and column separators.
