# State Machine

- In Studio, the State Machine workflow layout lets you design event-driven processes based on a finite number of states and transitions. 

- This layout should be used for high level project organization for complex and continuous processes. 

- For this reason, State Machines are often used in Main.xaml for RPA frameworks like the Robotic Enterprise Framework.
