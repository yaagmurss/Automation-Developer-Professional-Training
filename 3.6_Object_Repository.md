***Object Repository***

- The Object Repository allows for creating and reusing UI taxonomies inside and across automation projects.
- With Object Repository you can build a UI API for your application and share it with your team within minutes.







***Object Repository's key features***







***Centralized Storage***

- Object repositories allow you to store and manage reusable components, activities, and workflows so they are easy to access, update, and maintain.


***Reusability***

- A repository enables the creation of reusable components, activities, and workflows that can be easily shared and reused across multiple automation projects.
- This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to recreate the same functionality across multiple projects.


***Version Control***

- Object repositories support version control, so developers can manage different versions of components or activities.
- When updating or making changes to existing assets, this feature ensures that older versions can still be referenced if necessary.



***Collaboration***

- It facilitates collaboration between team members by providing a shared place to store and share automation assets.
- Multiple developers are able to collaborate, contribute to, and benefit from each other's work.



***MetaData and Documentation**


- Developers can add metadata and documentation to describe the purpose, usage, and dependencies of each asset, which improves understanding and promotes consistency when using the assets across projects.


***Search and Discovery***

- Search capabilities provide quick access to specific components or activities based on keywords, descriptions, or tags, reducing duplication.




***Dependencies Management***

- The object repository enables developers to define relationships and dependencies between different components and activities so that changes in one asset will be reflected in all dependent assets.



***Security and Acces Control***

- It provides security and access control features, which enable administrators to define user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals are permitted access, modification, and deletion of repository assets.



***Benefits of using the Object Repository***

- UI elements across the project are managed, updated, and modified from a centralized place.
  
- View a list of all your UI activities inside your process by using the UI Activities tab inside Object Repository panel.
  
- Quickly capture elements you need in your automation with the Capture Elements wizard.
  
- Increased selector reliability with the help of the Capture Elements recorder that captures elements, together with their anchors.
  
- Drag-and-drop elements from the Object Repository panel.
  
- Objects are reusable in local project or across projects when packaged as libraries.
  
- Upgrade application and process UI elements in one go with UI libraries.



***Object Repository Structure***

- The object repository has a tree structure where each node is an object representing screens or elements, all hierarchical under the application. The structure is the following: 

- ***Application*** - It can be one of 2 types: mobile or desktop/web, depending on what technology is used for UI Automation.     2

- ***Version*** - Applications can have multiple versions 
    

- ***Screen*** - Top-level window of an application version that can only be created under an app version. 
    

- ***UI Element*** - An object on the screen with a descriptor and metadata. It can be of multiple types.



***Introduction to key concepts***


- ***UI Descriptors :*** A UI Descriptor is a superset of selectors. It holds information for uniquely identifying elements on the screen.
- UI Descriptors are extracted from activties in the workflow and added to a structured schema that groups them by Applications, Application Versions, Screens, and UI Elements.
- Out of this taxonomy structure, only Screens and Elements hold descriptor information.
- The rest are used for grouping and their role is to ensure upgrades between versions of an application.
- UI Descriptors can be part of: One project for wide reuse. Snippets repositories for testing purposes. UI Libraries for global cross-project sharing




- ***UI Applications :*** A UI Application is a targeted application that can have multiple versions and each version can have multiple screens.
- Applications can be of multiple types: Desktop/ Web Application. Mobile Application




- ***Screens*** : Screens are UI Scopes that are either extracted from activities inside the workflow or are generated at element capture time.
- A screen groups together multiple elements belonging to the same screen. 


- ***UI Elements*** : UI Elements contain full or partial element selectors, anchor selectors, screen and element image capture context, and other metadata that describes the element on the screen. 


- ***UI Libraries*** : A UI Library is an encapsulation of elements grouped by applications, application versions, and screens.
- The elements you define can be extracted as a UI Library, and after publishing, can be installed in other projects as a dependency.
- A UI Library may contain several applications but can contain only one version of a certain application.
- This mechanism ensures that when you upgrade a dependency, you also upgrade the application version you were using inside your projects.


- ***UI Activities*** :  UI Activities allows you to view a list of all your UI activities inside your process.

***Note*** : UI Element targeting methods can be like below : 

- Strict Selector
- Fuzzy Selector
- Image
- Anchor
