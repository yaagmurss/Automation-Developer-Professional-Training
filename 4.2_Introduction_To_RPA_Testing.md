# RPA Testing


- RPA is software. It goes through all the software development stages, including testing. RPA testing deals with issues that are typically discovered in production, but aims to do it as early as possible in the process.
  
  

# Levels of RPA testing



- Since RPA development goes through the regular software development stages, RPA testing is not at all different from software testing.
  

  
- There are four main levels: unit (component) testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.


***Unit(Component) Testing***



- It is called unit testing because the functionality of an automation project should be broken down into units or components (in the form of workflows) which can be tested individually.


 - Unit testing has the greatest effect on the quality of the project when it is integrated in the development process and done by the developers themselves.


- In unit testing, non-essential or complex objects should be replaced with mock objects.





***Integration Testing***



- In this type of testing, the focus is on the interactions between the components or systems.

- This is typically a subsequent phase after assuring the quality at component level.


- This can be done by professional testers or by developers. It can be also done in a continuous integration/continuous deployment framework, in which a test set is executed every time a new functionally is added to an existing automation. 



***System Testing***




- The focus here is the entire system. In large end to end automation, this would come after the different components have been tested in different configurations and scenarios. 



- System testing requires a dedicated pre-production environment, where testers can get the same experience tha the user would have after the automation goes alive. The PDD should contain many usefull information to create test cases for this level.





***Acceptance Testing***

- This also deals with the entire system, but is performed by business users. The goal here is to check if the target audience interacts with the software differently than the developer have intented.





***Comprehensive Tools within the UiPath Test Suite and their Integration***



- Testing includes many tasks like running tests, making reports, handling requirements and problems, connecting with CI/CD, and doing exploratory testing. For successful testing, it's important to smoothly use many tools together.



- The UiPath Test Suite has tools that work well together, helping testing work better and connect with test management and ALM tools. The diagram below shows all the tools in the UiPath Test Suite and how they work together. 



***Studio***


- It lets you make automated tests similar to creating RPA workflows.
- It enables you to mimic user interactions and actions within the RPA process, allowing the creation of test cases that verify the accuracy and reliability of automated workflows.
- It gives you a visual way to design test scenarios, set input data, decide expected results, and build the steps for running tests.  
- It also helps you debug and solve problems in test cases before using them. 





***Orchestrator***


- It enables seamless coordination between testing robots and test cases created in UiPath Studio.
- In addition to running RPA workflows, you can use Orchestrator to make testing robots run test cases created in Studio. You can schedule this to happen or set it off with a CI/CD pipeline. 
- Orchestrator provides monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track the progress and results of test case executions in real-time. 





***Test Manager***

- You can use a web application hosted by the Test Management Hub to manage your testing process effectively. This application focuses on the following functions:
- You can link automated test cases in Studio to manual test cases in Test Manager.    Assign test cases to specific requirements.
- Access reporting and dashboards for a rapid view of your test outcomes.
- Conduct manual testing.
- Generate defects directly from test results.
- Include documentation for manual test cases using Task Capture.



***Test Robots***

- It executes the test cases.
