# RPA Testing


- RPA is software. It goes through all the software development stages, including testing. RPA testing deals with issues that are typically discovered in production, but aims to do it as early as possible in the process.
  
  

# Levels of RPA testing



- Since RPA development goes through the regular software development stages, RPA testing is not at all different from software testing.
  

  
- There are four main levels: unit (component) testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.


***Unit(Component) Testing***



- It is called unit testing because the functionality of an automation project should be broken down into units or components (in the form of workflows) which can be tested individually.


 - Unit testing has the greatest effect on the quality of the project when it is integrated in the development process and done by the developers themselves.


- In unit testing, non-essential or complex objects should be replaced with mock objects.





***Integration Testing***



- In this type of testing, the focus is on the interactions between the components or systems.

- This is typically a subsequent phase after assuring the quality at component level.


- This can be done by professional testers or by developers. It can be also done in a continuous integration/continuous deployment framework, in which a test set is executed every time a new functionally is added to an existing automation. 



***System Testing***




- The focus here is the entire system. In large end to end automation, this would come after the different components have been tested in different configurations and scenarios. 



- System testing requires a dedicated pre-production environment, where testers can get the same experience tha the user would have after the automation goes alive. The PDD should contain many usefull information to create test cases for this level.





***Acceptance Testing***

- This also deals with the entire system, but is performed by business users. The goal here is to check if the target audience interacts with the software differently than the developer have intented.
