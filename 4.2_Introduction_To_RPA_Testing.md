# RPA Testing


- RPA is software. It goes through all the software development stages, including testing. RPA testing deals with issues that are typically discovered in production, but aims to do it as early as possible in the process.
  
  

# Levels of RPA testing



- Since RPA development goes through the regular software development stages, RPA testing is not at all different from software testing.
  

  
- There are four main levels: unit (component) testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.


***Unit(Component) Testing***



- It is called unit testing because the functionality of an automation project should be broken down into units or components (in the form of workflows) which can be tested individually.


 - Unit testing has the greatest effect on the quality of the project when it is integrated in the development process and done by the developers themselves.


- In unit testing, non-essential or complex objects should be replaced with mock objects.





***Integration Testing***



- In this type of testing, the focus is on the interactions between the components or systems.

- This is typically a subsequent phase after assuring the quality at component level.


- This can be done by professional testers or by developers. It can be also done in a continuous integration/continuous deployment framework, in which a test set is executed every time a new functionally is added to an existing automation. 



***System Testing***




- The focus here is the entire system. In large end to end automation, this would come after the different components have been tested in different configurations and scenarios. 



- System testing requires a dedicated pre-production environment, where testers can get the same experience tha the user would have after the automation goes alive. The PDD should contain many usefull information to create test cases for this level.





***Acceptance Testing***

- This also deals with the entire system, but is performed by business users. The goal here is to check if the target audience interacts with the software differently than the developer have intented.





***Comprehensive Tools within the UiPath Test Suite and their Integration***



- Testing includes many tasks like running tests, making reports, handling requirements and problems, connecting with CI/CD, and doing exploratory testing. For successful testing, it's important to smoothly use many tools together.



- The UiPath Test Suite has tools that work well together, helping testing work better and connect with test management and ALM tools. The diagram below shows all the tools in the UiPath Test Suite and how they work together. 



***Studio***


- It lets you make automated tests similar to creating RPA workflows.
- It enables you to mimic user interactions and actions within the RPA process, allowing the creation of test cases that verify the accuracy and reliability of automated workflows.
- It gives you a visual way to design test scenarios, set input data, decide expected results, and build the steps for running tests.  
- It also helps you debug and solve problems in test cases before using them. 





***Orchestrator***


- It enables seamless coordination between testing robots and test cases created in UiPath Studio.
- In addition to running RPA workflows, you can use Orchestrator to make testing robots run test cases created in Studio. You can schedule this to happen or set it off with a CI/CD pipeline. 
- Orchestrator provides monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track the progress and results of test case executions in real-time. 





***Test Manager***

- You can use a web application hosted by the Test Management Hub to manage your testing process effectively. This application focuses on the following functions:
- You can link automated test cases in Studio to manual test cases in Test Manager.    Assign test cases to specific requirements.
- Access reporting and dashboards for a rapid view of your test outcomes.
- Conduct manual testing.
- Generate defects directly from test results.
- Include documentation for manual test cases using Task Capture.



***Test Robots***

- It executes the test cases.

# Introduction to Test Cases 

- UiPath Test Suite offers a complete solution for RPA testing during automation development, as well as during integration and before moving it into production. Depending on the deployment model, RPA testing can be integrated in a continuous integration environment.



- But the first goal of RPA testing—at least chronologically—is to address application issues and automation issues as early as possible, in the RPA development phase. 



***Test Case***


- According to the behavior-driven development model, a test case is made of three distinct sections; Given, When and Then.





***Given***


- This block is where the initializition is done, in order for the best case to perform correctly.



- For example, the environment is prepared by opening the right applications and configuring them. 



***When Section***


- Typically, this where the rpa workflow is being invoked and run using the input test data.

- It shoukd contain the test scope, more precisely the excat steps required to execute your test case.





***Then***

- This point is verification point. It is where the test case output data is verified against the expected outcome, typically using the dedicated activities in the testing package.







***The verification activities***

- These activities are meant to be used in the Then block, to verify the outcomes of a test case execution.




***Verify Expression***


- This activity verifies a single expression (e.g. whether two variables are equal). Its outcome can be True or False.



***Verify Expression with Operator***


- This is the most versatile activity in the Testing Activities Package. It allows the comparison of a property returned by another Activity with an expression, variable or argument. Its outcome can also be True or False.


***Verify Range***

- This activity verifies whether an expression exists within a specified range. You must insert the expressions to be tested in their respective property fields. 





***Basic vs. data-driven test cases***

- Basic test cases run with a single set of data, and typically verify the outcomes against static values. To test an RPA workflow in different scenarios, data-driven testing is used. Data-driven testing allows you to test your RPA workflows and applications to make sure that the automations can handle multiple scenarios. 



- A basic test case can be easily converted to a data-driven test case by adding the file with the data variations. When doing so, arguments are automatically created with the names of the columns in the data variation file.


***Mock Testing***

- Automation projects often deal with business applications lacking a separate non-production environment. In such cases, testing the RPA workflows during development can become risky, through the effects in production, or costly, through the special resources needed.

- Mock testing, or mocking, offers a way of replacing dependencies by creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. These objects are typically out of scope for the testing effort, at least in the unit testing stages.
