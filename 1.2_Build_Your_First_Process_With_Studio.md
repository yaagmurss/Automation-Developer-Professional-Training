***What is an As-Is Process?***

- An As-Is business process is a detailed overview of the current state of a company's process, culture, and capabilities. It outlines how work is currently performed and how information flows through the organization. The purpose of an As-Is business process is to provide a baseline for identifying areas for improvement, optimizing the use of resources, and ultimately increasing efficiency and productivity. By understanding how work is currently being performed, organizations can develop strategies to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce waste, and enhance overall business processes.

***What is a To-Be Process?***

- A To-Be business process outlines how a company's process, culture, and capabilities will appear in the future. It serves as a roadmap for change, identifying where the organization needs to be in order to achieve its goals. The purpose of a To-Be business process is to provide a clear picture of what the future state of the organization will look like, and what steps need to be taken to achieve it. By creating a To-Be business process, organizations can prioritize and focus on the most critical changes necessary to achieve their goals and close the gaps between the current and desired states.

# ***What makes a process a good candidate for automation?***

There are two sets of criteria you can use to determine automation potential: 

***Process Fitness***
- Rule-Based (Process needs to have pre-defined logic + The exception rate is either low or can be included as well in the business logic)
- Automatable and/or reptitive
- Standart Input (The input in the process should either be electronic or easily readable or readable technology can be associated with Rpa (Such as OCR))
- Stable (Process that have been same for a certain period. No changes are expected)
	
	 
***Automation complexity***
- Number of screens (The higher the number of screens, the more elements have to be captured and configured before process automation.)
- Types of applications (Some applications are more easily automated (such as the Office suite or browsers), others heavily increase the automation effort (Mainframe, for example).)
- Business logic scenarios (An automation's complexity increases with the number of decision points in the business logic. 	
- Types and number of inputs 

***How do RPA project implementations work?***
- Discovery and Kick Off (assess the potential automations)
- Process Analysis (identifies the requirements of the customer’s processes.)
- Solution Design (the technical team designs a future state flow and maps out the various modules that'll have to be developed to complete the automation.)
- Development Unit Testing
- Integration and User Acceptance Testing (Uat)
- Deployment and Hypercare
