# ***Target***

- We can describe target as a goal of a activity like a button to click or a text box to type into

- We use target and anchor to identify the correct button, check boxes or dropdown list or the fetch the correct data from te web page/application

- Target is UI element you want to interact

# ***Anchor***
  
- We refer to another UI element as a reference to identify out target

# ***Selection Option Window***

- It allows us to indicate and configure the UI element
  
- When the target highlighted in green, it means the element is identified.
  
- "Pause" option helps us to pause our selection (selection stops for 3 sec.) ***F2***
  
- "Hover able" option, We want to select any UI element, If that is avaible only on hover ***F6***
  
- "Image selection mode" ***F3*** We can use image selection mode for both anchor and target. After pressing F3 then we hold the left mouse button and drag around a region.

# ***Use Application/Browser Activity***

Opens a desktop application or web page to use in UI automation.


- ***Indicate target on screen*** - Indicate the application again.

  
- ***Highlight Target*** - View the indicated application on your screen surrounded in a box.

  
- ***Show informative screenshot*** - View a screenshot of the target application or web page.

  
- ***Remove informative screenshot*** - Remove the screenshot of the target application or web page.

  
- ***OCR Engine***

  
- Embedded OCR Engine  : Use the OCR engine embedded in the Computer Vision AI model, namely UiPath Screen OCR.


- Custom OCR Engine : Use a custom OCR engine. When this option is selected, a panel is added in the activity card where you can drop a different OCR engine activity than UiPath Screen OCR.

  
  
***Common Section***
  
- ***Continue on error*** : Automation should continue even when the activity throws an error.
- ***Display Name*** : As best practice each activity have a unique name
- ***Timeout*** : Specifies a number of seconds it needs to wait before throwing error(Default value is 30 sec.)

  
***Unified Application Target Section Under the Input Section***

- ***Arguments*** : We can use this property to open a spesific file with the application (For example spesific notepad file path).
- ***File Path*** : It is the full path of executable file to open.
- ***Selector*** : Enables identification of a spesific user interface element through it is adress and attributes.
- ***URL*** : Specifies the URL of the web page to open.If a URL is specified then the file path property is cleared.


***Input/Output Section***
- Input Element - The target element you want to use with this application, stored in an UIElement object. This object can be retrieved from the Output Element property of another UI Automation activity. You can use this property field to pass the target element from a previous activity to this one without having to indicate it again. This field supports only UIElement variables.
- Output Element - Outputs the target element indicated in this activity to an UIElement variable which can then be reused in other activities. This field supports only UIElement variables.


***Misc Section***
- ***Private*** : Related to logging. If it is selected, the values of variables and arguments are no logged at verbose level.


***Options Section***

- ***Close*** : Select when to close the target application after the automation executes all the activities added inside this activity. 'Never' means never close the application. 'IfOpenedByAppBrowser' means close only if the application was opened by the automation. This is the default value. 'Always' means close the application every time.

- ***Input mode*** : Select which method the Robot should use to interact with the target application. 'Hardware Events' uses the hardware driver to perform the action. This is the slowest method, it cannot work in the background, but it is compatible with all desktop apps. 'Simulate' using accessibility APIs. Recommended for browsers, Java based applications, SAP. Usually more reliable than Hardware Events. Sends all text in a single action. Works even if target app is not in focus. Please test if your target application UI element supports this. 'Chromium API' performs actions using debugger APIs. Works only for Chromium elements. Sends all text in one go. Works even if target app is not in focus. 'Window Messages' simulate using Win32 messages. Recommended for desktop apps. Usually more reliable than Hardware Events. Sends all text in a single action. Works even if target app is not in focus. Please test if your target application UI element supports this. 'Background' runs actions in the background. Tries to use either Simulate or Chromium API where possible, while complex activities (image, native text) run as usual, in the foreground. It is highly recommended to use this method with the Verify Execution feature. Note: Using the Background input mode with Universal Windows Platform applications is not supported, which means applications of this type cannot be automated in the background.

- ***Open*** : Select when to open the target application for the execution of the automation. 'Never' means never open the application. 'IfNotOpen' means open only if the application is closed. This is the default value. Works only if the File Path or URL fields are populated. 'Always' means open another instance of the application even if one is already open. Works only if the File Path or URL fields are populated.

- ***User Data Folder Mode*** : The UserDataFolderMode you want to set. It is used to start the browser with a specific user data folder. 'Automatic' means picture In Picture mode uses a different folder than the default mode, automatically generated if UserDataFolderPath is not set. 'DefaultFolder' means uses the default browser folder, no matter if it runs in the main or PIP session. 'CustomFolder' means uses the folder specified in UserDataFolderPath or an auto generated path if UserDataFolderPath is not set.

# ***ChromiumAPI***

- ChromiumAPI is a browser automation input method based on the Devtools protocol. It is 100% compatible with Chromium-based browsers, like Chrome or Edge. Basically, it works on any website or application executed inside the Chromium browser. It works with the following activities: Use Application/Browser,  Click, Type Into, Hover,  Keyboard Shortcuts.

- Using the Hardware Events input method for all the input actions, these actions communicate with the operating system’s mouse/keyboard input stream. From there, the events are sent to the target application, the browser, which parses them and sends them further to the web pages. 

- With ChromiumAPI, the events are sent directly to the browser. Therefore, this input method removes a communication channel that can fail (as any other communication channel).

- Hardware Events input method needs elements to be on the screen, focused, and in the foreground. The ChromiumAPI doesn't require it as it works while the browser is minimized and/or another tab is focused.

- Benefits of using ChromiumAPI over Simulate input method : It allows sending hotkeys directly to the browser, wherein Simulate doesn't support hotkeys. The Clear before typing property is natural with this method, since it doesn't empty the target element field by default. Click with modifiers actions are more efficient and reliable.

***Output Activites***


***Get Text Activity***
  
- Get Text Activity Extracts and copies the text from a UI element. It should be added inside a Use Application/Browser Activity.
  
- You can use this Activity to extract data using the following output methods: 'Default' tries all the output methods, and the first one to return a text is used. 'Text attribute' uses the "text" attribute of the UI element. 'Fulltext' this method offers the option to Ignore hidden text, which can be activated by selecting its respective check box. 'Native', this method enables you to Allow formatting and retrieve the screen coordinates of the words by selecting the check boxes for each of these features.

- Get Text Activity provides the Extraction Preview wizard. This wizard enables you to choose the suitable output method based on the result displayed in the Extraction Preview wizard.


 ***CV Get Text***
  
- Extracts the text from a specified UI element position based on an anchor. It should be added inside a CV Screen Scope Activity. It supports the following methods: 'OCR' uses the OCR engine specified in the parent CV Screen Scope activity to retrieve the text. 'Select - all' extract the entire text by using the clipboard. This simulates a copy/paste action and can only be used on selectable text, on either local or remote sessions. 'Select - row' extract the text in the entire row by using the clipboard. This simulates a copy/paste action and can only be used on selectable text, on either local or remote sessions.

 ***Get Ocr Text***

- Extracts a string and its information from an indicated UI element or image using the OCR screen scraping method. This Activity gets generated automatically when performing screen scraping, along with a container. By default, the Google OCR engine is used.


# ***Table Extraction***

- Table Extraction enables us to automatically extract structured data from applications and save it as a Data Table object. 


- Table exaction has four sections. Information section guides us through all the steps we need to take to successfully extract any structured data. Extracted data section provides all the details about extracted data. Here we can also edit the extraction. 


- Each column can be individually edited or deleted, enabling us to customize our final table. Setting section allows us to set the limits for our extraction. Preview section allows us to preview the extracted data. Add data button to begin the extraction.

 

- Finish selection confirms the selection for the column. “extract URL’s and images sources of the extracted Data” allows to extract the URL/image automatically associate with selection and adds it as different column. we’ll use Next button, If data is spanning multiple pages by indicating the next button link.
