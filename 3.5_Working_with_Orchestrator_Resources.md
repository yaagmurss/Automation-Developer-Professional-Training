***Storage Budgets***

- Storage Buckets are Orchestrator entities used for storing files which can be used in automation projects. UiPath Studio offers a set of activities to simplify working with Storage Buckets. These activities are available in the UiPath.System.Activities pack, under Orchestrator.

- Storage Buckets can be created using the Orchestrator database or some external providers, such as Azure, Amazon, or MinIO. Each Storage Buckets is a folder-scoped entity, allowing fine-grained control over storage and content access.



***Queues***

- These items are designed to be indivisible units of work: a customer contract, an invoice, a complaint, etc. Queues are extremely important for large-scale automation projects. They allow the storage and processing of basically unlimited amounts of data.

- Queues are containers that can hold an unlimited number of items. Items can store multiple types of data, by default in free form. If a specific data schema is needed, it can be uploaded at queue creation in the form of a JSON file.

- Such scenarios pose many challengesâ€”bringing items from multiple sources together, processing them according to a unique logic, efficient use of resources, or reporting capabilities at individual item and queue level, including the use of SLAs. 

***Creating A Queue**

- When creating a queue, you set the maximum number of retries (the number of times you want a queue item to be retried) and the Unique Reference field (select Yes, if you want the transaction references to be unique). You can update existing queue settings, such as: The queue name, The Auto Retry option, The maximum number of retries.

- In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. Bulk upload is supported directly in Orchestrator, from .csv files.


***Populating and consuming queues***

- To ensure an optimal use of the robots, queues are typically used with the Dispatcher-Performer model of running automations. In this model, the two main stages of a process involving queues are separated:

- The stage in which data is taken and fed into a queue in Orchestrator, from where it can be taken and processed by the robots is called Dispatcher.

- The stage in which the data is processed is called Performer.

- Working with queues and queue items is done using the specific activities from the UiPath. System. Activities official package, under Orchestrator. These are:


***Add Transaction Item***

- The robot adds an item in the queue and starts the transaction with the status 'In progress'. The queue item cannot be sent for processing until the robot finalizes this activity and updates the status.


***Get Transaction Item***

- Gets an item from the queue to process it, setting the status to 'In progress'.



***PostPone Transaction Item***

- Adds time parameters between which a transaction must be processed.




***Set Transaction Progress***

- Enables the creation of custom progress statuses for In Progress transactions. This can be useful for transactions that have a longer processing duration, and breaking down the workload will give valuable information.


***Set Transaction Status***

- Changes the status of the transaction item to Failed (with an Application or Business Exception) or Successful. As a general approach, a transaction failed due to Application Exceptions will be retried, and a transactions failed due to Business Exceptions will not be retried.

***Queue item statuses***


-  A queue item can have one of the statuses below. These will be set automatically following human user and robot actions, and/or using the Set Transaction Status activity. Custom sub-statuses can be set for queue items which are 'In Progress', using the Set Transaction Progress activity.



***New***

- The item was just added to the queue with Add Queue Item, or the item was postponed, or a deadline was added to it, or the item was added after an attempt and failure of a previous queue item with auto-retry enabled. 



***In Progress***

- The item was processed with the Get Transaction Item or the Add Transaction Item activity. When an item has this status, the custom progress status is also displayed, in the Progress column.




***Failed***

- The item did not meet a business or application requirement within the project. It was therefore sent to a Set Transaction Status activity, which changed its status to Failed 



***Successfull***

- The item was processed and sent to a Set Transaction Status activity, which changed its status to Successful.




***Abandoned***

- The item remained in the In Progress status for a long period of time (approx. 24 hours) without being processed.



***Retried***

- The item failed with an application exception and was retried (at the end of the process retried, the status will be updated to a final one - Successful or Failed.



***Deleted***

- The item has been manually deleted from the Transactions page.

# Notes

- Resources can be assets, queues, and processes that are stored in Orchestrator folders, including in personal workspaces.
  
- An awesome feature available to us is the possibility to share any of these resources across folders. If we click Manage Links, we can specify in which folder we want to share our Test Queue. An icon next to the queue indicates that it's shared with another folder.We can also find the queue in the second folder.

- By clicking the green button on the right side of the screen, we can switch folders. And we can see data manager's resources.
