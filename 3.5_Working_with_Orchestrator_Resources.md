# Orchestrator Resources 

 
# Notes

- Resources can be assets, queues, and processes that are stored in Orchestrator folders, including in personal workspaces.
  
- An awesome feature available to us is the possibility to share any of these resources across folders. If we click Manage Links, we can specify in which folder we want to share our Test Queue. An icon next to the queue indicates that it's shared with another folder.We can also find the queue in the second folder.

- By clicking the green button on the right side of the screen, we can switch folders. And we can see data manager's resources.
