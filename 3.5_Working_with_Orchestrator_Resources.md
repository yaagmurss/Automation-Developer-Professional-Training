# Orchestrator Resources 

***Storage Buckets***


- Orchestrator entities used for stroring files which can be used in automation projects.

- Storage buckets can be crated using the Orchestrator database or some external providers such as Azure, Amazon, MinIO.

- Each Storage buckets is a folder-scoped entitiy allowing fine-grained control over storage and content accces.

- When you need to use large files stored in centralized location or  When you need to grant acces to multiple robots an a controlled way.


---------

***Queues***

- Queues are containers that can hold unlimited number of items. Items can store multiple types of data, by default in free form. If a spesific data schema is needed, it can be uploaded at queue creation in the form of a JSON file.


- Bringing items from multiple sources together, processing them according to a uniques logic, efficent use of resources, or reporting capabilities at individual item and queue level, including the use of SLA's.


***Creating queues***

- Queues are easily created in Orchestrator from the entry in the menu with the same name. They are folder entities, which allow setting up fine-grained permissions.

- When creating a queue, you set the maximum number of retries (the number of times you want a queue item to be retried) and the Unique Reference field (select Yes, if you want the transaction references to be unique).
-  You can update existing queue settings, such as: The queue name.The Auto Retry option.The maximum number of retries.

- In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. Bulk upload is supported directly in Orchestrator, from .csv files.

***Populating and consuming queues***

- To ensure an optimal use of the robots, queues are typically used with the Dispatcher-Performer model of running automations. In this model, the two main stages of a process involving queues are separated:

- The stage in which data is taken and fed into a queue in Orchestrator, from where it can be taken and processed by the robots is called Dispatcher.

- The stage in which the data is processed is called Performer.
