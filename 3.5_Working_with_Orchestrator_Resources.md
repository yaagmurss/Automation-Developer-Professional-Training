# Orchestrator Resources 

***Storage Budgets***

- Storage Buckets are Orchestrator entities used for storing files which can be used in automation projects. UiPath Studio offers a set of activities to simplify working with Storage Buckets. These activities are available in the UiPath.System.Activities pack, under Orchestrator.

- Storage Buckets can be created using the Orchestrator database or some external providers, such as Azure, Amazon, or MinIO. Each Storage Buckets is a folder-scoped entity, allowing fine-grained control over storage and content access.















 
# Notes

- Resources can be assets, queues, and processes that are stored in Orchestrator folders, including in personal workspaces.
  
- An awesome feature available to us is the possibility to share any of these resources across folders. If we click Manage Links, we can specify in which folder we want to share our Test Queue. An icon next to the queue indicates that it's shared with another folder.We can also find the queue in the second folder.

- By clicking the green button on the right side of the screen, we can switch folders. And we can see data manager's resources.
