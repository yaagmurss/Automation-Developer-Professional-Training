# What is logging?

Logging can be defined as the process of recording events or actions that occur during the execution of a workflow. It involves creating log messages that contain details such as process start/end, timestamps, error messages, severity levels of messages, user inputs, or any other information relevant to an action and then storing them in a Log file. 

# Types of logs in UiPath

- Studio logs. 

- Setup Logs

- Orchestrator diagnostic logs.

# Robot logs

***There are two types of Robot logs:***

- ***Robot execution logs:*** These are messages generated by the execution of a process and contain information related to its behavior and user-defined messages. 

- ***Robot diagnostics log:*** These provide information related to the Robot itself and its context


# Accessing logs 

There are several places where you can access Robot Execution Logs: 

- In the Output Panel in UiPath Studio for the previous process execution from Studio. 

- In the %localappdata%\UiPath\Logs\<shortdate>_Execution.log file for all processes ran on the machine from UiPath Studio. Logs are generated at Trace level and above or Verbose level and above depending on whether the Verbose level is activated or not. 

- In the %localappdata%\UiPath\Logs\<shortdate>_Execution.log file for all processes ran on the machine from UiPath Assistant. The logs are generated at the level defined in UiPath Assistant and above. 

- In Orchestrator, in the Logs section when running processes while connected to Orchestrator. The logs are generated at the defined level and above.
